# /swarm - Coordinated Multi-Agent Execution

Spawn and manage coordinated agents using the blackboard pattern with access to 99 specialized agents.

## Usage

```bash
/swarm [task]    # Execute task with agent picker
/swarm show      # View full state
/swarm reset     # Clear blackboard
/swarm stop      # Stop monitoring
```

## Examples

```bash
/swarm investigate the authentication system
/swarm implement feature X
/swarm show
/swarm reset
```

## Instructions

### `/swarm <task>` (Execute with Agent Picker)

**With task:** Start fresh coordinated execution

1. **Initialize** (if needed):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/.coordination
   python ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/watcher/watcher_loop.py clear
   ```

2. **Analyze task** and recommend agents from pool:

   Based on task keywords, suggest relevant specialists:
   - Authentication → security-auditor, backend-architect
   - API design → backend-architect, graphql-architect
   - Performance → performance-engineer, debugger
   - Frontend → frontend-developer, ui-ux-designer
   - Database → database-architect, sql-pro

3. **Show agent picker**:

   ```markdown
   ## Swarm Plan

   **Task:** [task]

   ### Recommended Agents:

   CORE (recommended):
   [x] backend-architect (opus) - API design, microservices
   [x] security-auditor (opus) - Security review

   SUPPORT (optional):
   [ ] test-automator (sonnet) - Test coverage
   [ ] code-reviewer (opus) - Code review
   [ ] debugger (sonnet) - Error analysis

   ### Custom Selection:
   Categories: backend, frontend, security, database, quality, ai_ml, debugging, docs, languages

   [Start] [Auto-select all] [Cancel]
   ```

4. **Load agent persona** from pool:

   For each selected agent, read its persona:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.opencode/agents/plugins/*/agents/[agent-name].md | head -50
   ```

   The persona file contains:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description, model tier)
   - Full persona instructions

5. **Spawn work agents** using Task tool with agent persona:

   **IMPORTANT:**
   - Include `[SWARM]` in description (triggers hooks)
   - Use `run_in_background: true` (Golden Rule #12)
   - Include agent persona in prompt

   ```markdown
   Task tool call:
   - description: "[SWARM] backend-architect: Design API"
   - prompt: |
       ## Agent Persona
       [Insert persona from ~/.opencode/agents/plugins/.../backend-architect.md]

       ## Task
       Your task: ...

       ## Output Format
       Report findings in ## FINDINGS section
   - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
   - model: "opus" | "sonnet" | "haiku" (per agent tier)
   - run_in_background: true
   ```

   **Model Selection by Agent Tier:**
   - Tier 1 (Opus): architecture, security, code review agents
   - Tier 2 (Inherit/Sonnet): most specialists
   - Tier 3 (Haiku): fast operational tasks

6. **Spawn watcher** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/watcher/watcher_loop.py prompt
   ```

   Then spawn with Task tool:

   ```markdown
   - description: "[WATCHER] Monitor swarm"
   - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
   - model: "haiku"
   - run_in_background: true
   - prompt: (output from above command)
   ```

7. **Iterate** on follow-up tasks from queue (max 5 iterations)

8. **Synthesize** all findings into summary

9. **Stop monitoring** when done:

   ```bash
   python ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/watcher/watcher_loop.py stop
   ```

### `/swarm show` (View State)

```bash
python ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/watcher/watcher_loop.py status
```

Also check blackboard:

```bash
cat ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/.coordination/blackboard.json | python -m json.tool
```

### `/swarm reset` (Clear)

Clear all state:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/.coordination/*
```

### `/swarm stop` (Disable)

Stop monitoring:

```bash
python ~/.opencode/emergent-learning/watcher/watcher_loop.py stop
```

## Finding Types

Agents report in `## FINDINGS` section:

- `[fact]` - Confirmed information
- `[hypothesis]` - Suspected pattern
- `[blocker]` - Cannot proceed
- `[question]` - Need input

## Constraints

- File-based IPC (no external services)
- Windows compatible
- Single-pass watchers (user-driven cycle)
- Max 5 iterations per swarm
